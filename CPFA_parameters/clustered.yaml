# Parameters for CPFA

# Increase these values to increease probability
probabilityOfSwitchingToSearching: 0.13 
probabilityOfReturningToNest: 0.0

# Uses a gaussian random num generator 
# This value represents the std dev around the current 
# heading for the next random heading in an uninformed search
uninformedSearchVariation: 0.4

# The inverse of the average expected time for the rover to 
# find a resource with an informed walk
#
# Example: If the rover takes on average 5 seconds to find a resource
# after switching an informed walk, then you will choose this value to be
# 1/5 = 0.2
rateOfInformedSearchDecay: 0.1666

# Reduce these values to increase the return vallue for the poisson distribution
rateOfSiteFidelity: 0.3
rateOfLayingPheromone: 5
rateOfPheromoneDecay: 0.025
